My project is a database for GameStop stores in Colorado. Basically it reads from three txt files, and creates a BST for the games. My program encompasses three stores: Boulder, Lafayette, and LakeWood. In this program you can find a game, increase the stock of the game and many other functions in relation to the details of the games themselves.


INSTRUCTIONS::::

in order for the program to run you need to run the .exe file with the names of the cities in the following order:
1. Boulder
2. Lafayette
3. LakeWood

this would look like the following:

./run.exe boulder.txt lafayette.txt lakewood.txt

I worked on this alone, i apologize for the lack of formatting and notes.
I did not spend too much time in looking for bugs, so hopefully you can catch them and fix them.
